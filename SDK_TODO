Sdk's To Do List :
_________________________________

In order to have a working and solid SDK, we still have to do :
Please modify this list =) , delete things that have been made.

- Defining the better way to implement localization (internationalisation)

- Finishing convention about where files are going, and the way we'll name them

- Choosing the best way to name static files which will be cached (see w/ Steven)

- Defining a convention about the code documentation

- Making sure that everyone is ok with this SDK, and that nothing have
been forgotten.

- Should we use unit testing ?
